			Model default events:
				- 'add'				  -> the model receives the event when is added to a collection 
			        - 'remove'			  -> the model receives the event when is removed from a collection
				- 'change'                        -> its firing the event if some attribute in the model is changing
				- 'change:attr_name'              -> its possible to only listen the change in the attribute 'attr_name'
				- 'destroy'
				- 'error'                         -> only if the 'validate' function is defined in the Model class

			Model default methods:
				- 'fetch'			  -> it expects a single JSON object from the server
				- 'save'
				- 'destroy'


			Model other features:
				- 'initialize'                    -> its called automatically once a model instance is being created
				- 'defaults'                      -> its possible define default values for the model 's attributes
				- 'validate'                      -> its possible to define validations over the model attributes 


			Model parameters at instantiation:
                                - When a model instance is created, it could receive as an argument two objects:
                                        - (1) A hash of attributes (an object) with the model's attributes:
						- Internally the name of this parameter is 'attributes' 
                                        - (2) A hash of attributes (an object) as extra options:
                                                - Internally the name of this parameter is 'options'
                                                - The predefined options (predefined attribute's name in the 'options' object) are:
                                                        - 'parse' -> its load the model's attributes with the result of calling over
								     the 'attributes' parameter the model's 'parse' method.
							- 'collection' -> its possible to pass to the model the collection to which it
							                  belongs.
						- In order to pass custom options to the model its necessary override the
                                                  'initialize' function declaring as a parameter both 'attributes' and 'options':
                                                        - Example:
                                                                - initialize: function (attributes, options) {

				- Example:
                                                -  m = new Test( { m_att1:val_m1, .., m_attn:val_mn }, { att1:val1, .., attn:valn });
                                                        - Where:
                                                                -  { m_att1:val_m1, .., m_attn:val_mn } is the 'attributes' object.
                                                                        - If I don't won't to pass it, I can pass:
                                                                                - 'null' and later use the model 'set' method
                                                                -  { att1:val1, .., attn:valn } is the 'options' object, and att1 to attn

			Model and collections:
				- The events between both are cascaded upwards and downwards:
					- An event fired in a model is automatically received in the collection to which it belongs:
						- For example, the collection can bind to itself to listen the event:
							- If the event is 'change': this.bind('change', function(model) { .. })
					- An event fired in a collection is automatically received in a collection 's model:
						- For example, the model can bind to itself to listen the event:
                                                	- If the event is 'remove': this.bind('remove', function(model) { .. })

					- 'className'

				(2) Reacting to these events:

			Views and jQuery (DOM management):
				- It is possible to call jQuery methods on 'this' ( this.$(selector) ), they will automatically 
				  be scoped to the current element:
					- So instead of searching the entire document for a given selection, it is only searching 
					  within the current DOM element associated to the view (referenced by 'el'):

		// Here I'm creating a model instance from the model class 'Test'.
		// One way to create a model instance is instantiating the model through the constructor with a hash of attributes:
		     // (a)  Example: window.test1 = new Test({'a': 'C1', 'b': 'B1'});
			   // It has the problem that the 'validate' method isn't called:
			       // So, the call above, despite has 'a' isn't machting the validation rule, is inserted in the model.
		     // (b) There is a similar problem with the collection 'create' method:
		           // When a model is created through 'create', it is instantiated with a hash of attributes:
		              // So, its better to create the model without 'create' and add it to the collection through its 'add' method.
		// To avoid the above problem I'm using the 'set' method.
		window.test1 = new Test(null, {'customModelOption': 'm'});
		test1.set({'a': 'A1', 'b': 'B1'});
	

		// Here I'm creating a view instance from the view class 'TestView':
		  // Its receiving as a parameter:
                      // (a) The model instance associated to the view instance.
		      // (b) The DOM element associated to the view (here the <div> with 'id' equals to 'main').
		window.testView = new TestView({
					           'model': test1

					         , 'el': $("#main")
					   });

		// Here I'm rendering the view.
		testView.render();

		/*

		 // An alternative way to implement the above code for the view (creation and rendering) could be:
		
		    // When the view instance doesn't have a DOM element as a parameter, backbone creates a new DOM element automatically:
                       // This new DOM element doesn't belongs to the HTML document (I should add it manually).
		    window.testView = new TestView({ 'model': test });


		    // Here I'm invoking the 'render' method from the view instance:
                       // The 'render' method add to the DOM element in the 'el' attribute the new DOM elements (the HTML list):
			  // But as the DOM element in the 'el' attribute isn't in the HTML document, I should add it manually
                          // in order to see it in the HTML document:
                            // As the method 'render' is chainable, I can get from it the 'el' value and add it to the
                           //  HTML document (here to the <div> with 'id' equals to 'main').
		    $("#main").append((testView.render()).el);

		// Invoking the model 's custom method:
			// The method 'addValue' is using the Model 'set' method internally, so its also firing the 'change' event:
			    // Thus, as the view is listening for the 'change' event, it renders again the GUI, and the new value
		            // for the 'a1' attribute is seen inmediatly in the HTML document (the GUI).
		test1.addValue('a', '.1');

		// Here I'm creating another model instance from the model class 'Test'.
                window.test2 = new Test();
		test2.set({'a': 'A2', 'b': 'B2'});

		// Here I'm creating a collection instance (a group of models) from the collection class 'Tests':
			// When creating a new instance of a collection it receives two parameteres:
				// (a) 'models': if I want to pass an array of models to the collection:
					// Here I'm passing 'null' instead of '{}' or '[]' to avoid calling 'this.reset':
						// Anyway, 'this.reset' is called with 'silent' in 'true', so the 'reset'
						// event isn't fired.
				// (b) 'options': if I want to pass extra options to the collection:
					// There is a standard option: 'comparator', its automatically loaded in the collection's
					// 'comparator' attribute
		window.tests = new Tests( null , { 'comparator': function() {alert('Comparator working')}, 'customCollectionOption': 'c' });

		// Here I'm grouping models (adding models to the collection):
		   // Its also possible to use the Collection 'fetch' method to retrieve models from a server:
			// The first time a page is loaded is better not use 'fetch' but 'reset' with data built
			// by the server, and sent inside of the HTML document itself.
		tests.add([test1, test2]);


		// Any of the built-in underscore methods could be used over a collection instance in order to work
		// with a group of models:
			// Here I'm invoking the 'map' method.
		res = tests.map( function(test) {

			return ( test.get('a') + ": map" );
		});

		// Only for testing purposes.
		res = "[" + res.toString() + "]";
		console.log("Result of map over the collection: " + res );
